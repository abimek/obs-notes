Motion Maps are a visual way to represent the motion of an object through time. This is stuff that we learned two years ago but we're reviewing. We start the calculus application soon.

## Diagram System
* Particle Diagrams for simplicty (Only Dots)!

## Vocab
* Speeding Up (Describing change in velocity)
* Slowing Down (Describing change in velocity)

## Stationary Objects
* An object at rest is at a signle positon on a motion map

## Moving Objects
**constant velocity**
* An object with a constant velocity will have equal spacing on a motion map.

**chaning velocity**
* An object with constant velocity will have unequal spacing. If the spacing goes from shorter to longer it's going faster. Longer to shorter means its going slower.
