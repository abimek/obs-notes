## Motion Maps/Diagrams
### Diagram System
* Particle Diagrams for simplicty (Only Dots)!

### Vocab
* Speeding Up (Describing change in velocity)
* Slowing Down (Describing change in velocity)

### Stationary
* An object at rest is at a signle positon on a motion map
#### TODO: IMAGE OF BALL STILL (USE DRAW)
### Motion
**constant velocity**
* An object with a constant velocity will have equal spacing on a motion map.
#### TODO: IMAGE OF PERSON SCATING WITH EQUAL SPACING
**chaning velocity**
* An object with constant velocity will have unequal spacing. If the spacing goes from shorter to longer it's going faster. Longer to shorter means its going slower.
