## 1D
Signs determine the direction of the object. This is with respect to the origin usually.
**example**
 v_x > 0 = velocity vector points to the right
## Graphs
### Postion vs Time graphs
* Linear Slope tells us something about the velocity
* Velocity is the derivitve of the position.
### Velocity vs Time
* Area = displacement of the position (basically whree the x is)
* 0 slope = linear position vs time

### Acceleration vs Time
8
* Always Linear
