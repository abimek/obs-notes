## Silicon Gadgets (Season 2 Prospect)
### NPC
Silco 
trade silicon for silicon gadgets (Ones that you have equipped, he has a custom trading ui compared to the rest as ti will be a chest with ? where you dont have stuff unlocked)

Silicon Gadgets can be used within your island to improve the islanding experience. First season will only inlcude a couple of silicon gadgets that can be crafted. Raw silicon needs to be refined in a Silicon Press which will take time and cost crystals + gold coins (CUSTOM UI). These raw silicon sheets can then be used at SIlco.

### Gadgets
* Tech Pouch
* Drill (Can be placed on island and has chance of fidning titanium)
* Silicon Armour
## Dungeons & Bosses (Last Feature )(Need sponsor for money for dungeon maps)
* Dungeon Worlds will be the last
Dungeons are similar to Cosmic Sky DUngeons OR Be Like Hypixels with different rooms (Probably hypixels now that I think of it). They can be accessed through some custom ui and you can progress through each dungeon. Dungeons have armor limits. Dungeons will be very difficult to progress through and have mobs that try to kill you. Dungeon mobs might drop good loot but you can only go into one dungeon every day, if you die you keep your items. Dungeon worlds will be created by builders.
## Purchasing Items
(Start off simple and this can be imrpoved in a later update)
Items can be traded for in the Hub / Spawn. 

### UI
* Custom Chest that Shows Available Trades OR Improved Villager Trading UI If DF doesn't use vailidations.

## Open World (Season 2 Prospect)

The open world comes with custom world gen where you can explore and attain specific items. This is a shared world with a 5k x 5k block place and break prevention. Raw resources can spawn in this world.

### Entities
Custom Entities Spawn in the Open World that drop good loot, some of these entities spawn rarely.

## Currency
The server has two different kinds of Currency, Gold Coins and Crystals.
### Gold Coins
Gold coins are the primary currency used, they can be used in the store.
### Crystals
Crystals can be used when purchasing special items like enchanting books (IDK IF THEY can be purchased yet) or other such items. They can also be required alongside gold coins sometimes. 

### UI

### Items

## Enchantment
* New Enchantments Will Be Added Every Season
* You can enchant items through Alfreds Enchanting Table.
* Alfreds Enchanting Table will cost a Lot of money to use economy wise.
* All enchantments can be gotten from any book of any rarity. This means you can get max level enchant form simple books.
* Each Enchantment will have a specific chance of popping up when you use Cosmos Enchantment Discovery UI.
* Each Enchantment Book will have an associated Break Percentage that lowers with the rarity of the book.
* Alfreds enchanting table can also improve the break percentage with an Enchantment Binder.
* Each enchantment will have its own tag in Fonts folder in resource pack. Each roman numeral letter will exist so that they can be used seperately.

### Enchants
* Titanium Miner (Allows you to mine titanium, (VERY RARE))

### UI
* Alfreds Enchantign Table (Similar Design To This)

* Cosmos Enchanting Discovery Table (More of a Brushing Off Theme Though)
![[Pasted image 20220822142846.png]]
> The Discovery Table lets you put in a plain book and get a specific enchantment book out.
### Enchantment Binders
* Enchantment Binders are custom items that can be placed within alfreds enchanting table to lower the chance of that enchantment book breaking an item. (I imagine this as some kind of item that holds the item together when applied, like the different pieces)
* Specific Type of Enchantment Binders for specific type of gear (boots, chestplate, sword, etc).
* Enchantment Binders can only be found in Crates and in the Open World.
